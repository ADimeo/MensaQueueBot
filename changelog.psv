1| News! We've published the first set of data with weekday graphs at https://github.com/ADimeo/MensaQueueBot/tree/master/analysis/data . In short, Tuesdays from 11:45 to 12:50 you don't want to be hungry, with maybe a small exception at 12:20. Wednesdays there's a small window between 12:10 and 12:30 that's ideal to go eat, and Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays feature much shorter lines all around, with Thursday being all over the place. But do check out those graphs, you made them possible!
