2| Great news! Not only can you collect points for your reports now (check /points_help for details), we're also proud to present the very first piece of crowdsourced data analysis (for the last semester), over at https://deepnote.com/@skn0tt/Mensa-Queue-Bot-Analytics-367dc54a-fc2f-4a38-a192-d5800af17360
3| News! In what is our biggest release yet, we've completely overhauled the /jetze command, and you can now look forward to fancy graphical reports. There's also a short survey at https://forms.gle/mq1X35ch1vx1Hb8U9 that we'll use to decide on our next features, feel free to fill it out while waiting in line!
