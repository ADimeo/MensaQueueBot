1| The weekday graphs for the last semester can be found at https://github.com/ADimeo/MensaQueueBot/tree/master/analysis/data/SS22 . Do check them out, contributers like you made them possible! But keep in mind that lectures and mensa usage may change this semester
2| Great news! Not only can you collect points for your reports now (check /points_help for details), we're also proud to present the very first piece of crowdsourced data analysis (for the last semester), over at https://deepnote.com/@skn0tt/Mensa-Queue-Bot-Analytics-367dc54a-fc2f-4a38-a192-d5800af17360
3| News! In what is our biggest release yet, we've completely overhauled the /jetze command, and you can now look forward to fancy graphical reports. And if you have suggestions for how to make those graphs prettier remember that @adimeo is your goto guy for complaints
