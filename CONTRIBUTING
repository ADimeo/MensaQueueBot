Contributors are very welcome.

Before you start implementing a feature ideally reach out to make sure that your work doesn't conflict with other work that is going on. 
Right now this project is small enough that I'll sometimes cut corners that wouldn't be cut in a larger project.

If you have a feature idea please open an issue before starting implementation, again to avoid conflicts.

For bugfixes/comparables I don't think prior coordination is required.
